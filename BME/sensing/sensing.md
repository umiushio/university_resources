  Linearity is the closeness of a sensor’s calibration curve to a specified straight line, and the specified straight line usually is the sensor’s theoretical behavior or its leastsquares fit. Linearity is expressed as a percent of the fullscale output (YF.S.), which is the maximum deviation (Δmax) of any calibration point from the corresponding point on the specified straight line, and it is usually denoted the maximum relative error as ε :
